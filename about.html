        <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">About Us</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">TCMU musicians play all styles of music, from classical to jazz to rock to folk to Latin and Brazilian and other world music, 
            and more — performing at the highest levels of artistry in every genre. 
            Our members are found in the major orchestras in our area; in the pits at local theaters; in clubs; in churches and synagogues; in major concert venues like Target Center, 
            Xcel Center, USBank Stadium and TCF Stadium; in the State Fair Grandstand and other venues throughout the fairgrounds; 
            enlivening corporate gatherings and conventions; enhancing important family milestones such as weddings (both indoors and out) — 
            just about any place you can think of where live music is heard. TCMU’s membership also includes educators, composers, arrangers, conductors, 
            music directors, orchestrators, copyists, and many other specialized roles within the music field.
            <br><br>
            TCMU has been serving Twin Cities area musicians since 1897 and continues to be an effective advocate for musicians’ rights in the workplace — whether that is a nightclub, 
            a symphony stage, a recording studio, or on tour. Along with the AFM, we help to protect our members’ recorded works from being exploited. 
            We stand behind members and provide legal clout when an employer defaults on a contract. 
            The musicians union also offers various benefit programs that help its members to build successful careers.
            <br><br>
            Members of TCMU are secure in knowing that their organization is actively lobbying to promote legislation and public awareness that protects musicians’ interests, 
            negotiating collective bargaining agreements with local purchasers, as well as the recording industry, motion picture industry, jingle industry, TV networks, 
            American Public Media, and other broadcast organizations. TCMU — along with our parent organization, 
            the AFM — is continually striving to improve wages and working conditions for its members.
            <br><br>
            This is an incredible network to be a part of! Feel free to explore this website and get an idea of what being a Union Musician is all about.</p>
